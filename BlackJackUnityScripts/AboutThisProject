This is my first graphical user interface project. As well as my first time working with Unity and Unity Scripts. Luckily unity scripts are very similar to C# so that helped quite a bit. Essentially this is a BlackJack video game. It took me at least 6 months to code this up in my freetime. I did use help from resources like ChatGPT and Geeks for Geeks when I got stuck. But I forced myself to make each method in my own way first, then use resources for help when necessary. Unfortunately I could not get a video of gameplay up. But when I get it to build I am hoping to inlcude a link or some way to play it.
